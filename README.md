# Cash-Flow-Minimizer

Welcome to the Cash Flow Minimizer project! This system is designed to minimize cash flow transactions among a group of individuals or entities, optimizing debt settlements using graph-based algorithms.

-Project Overview
The Cash Flow Minimizer program calculates and reduces the number of transactions needed to settle debts among individuals who owe each other money. By leveraging graph algorithms such as the Min-Cost Max-Flow algorithm, the project identifies the optimal way to settle debts with the least number of transactions.

-Example Scenario
Letâ€™s say we have the following individuals:

+ Alice
+ Bob
+ Charlie
+ Dave

These individuals have borrowed money from each other, and the goal is to minimize the total number of transactions needed to settle their debts.

-Transactions:
 - Alice owes Bob $300
 - Alice owes Charlie $200
 - Bob owes Dave $150
 - Charlie owes Dave $250

Using the Cash Flow Minimizer, these transactions can be optimized to reduce unnecessary payments.

-Output:
Instead of the individuals making separate payments, the optimized transactions would be as follows:

- Alice pays Charlie $50
- Bob pays Dave $100
- Charlie pays Dave $150

Key Features
- Graph-Based Optimization: Utilizes graph data structures to represent the flow of cash and implements Min-Cost Max-Flow and other algorithms to minimize transactions.
- Efficient Data Handling: Handles large volumes of transaction data and optimizes them for real-world applications.
- Algorithmic Techniques: Uses sorting, searching, and optimization techniques like dynamic programming and greedy algorithms for efficient cash flow settlement.

Learning Outcomes
- Mastery of graph algorithms and optimization techniques like Min-Cost Max-Flow.
- Experience in implementing efficient data structures (priority queues, graphs) for complex financial problems.
- Enhanced problem-solving skills by working with large datasets and real-world optimization challenges.

Real-World Applications
- Financial Institutions: Banks can utilize this system to optimize interbank settlements and reduce transaction costs.
- Corporate Use: Companies can apply this model for internal settlements between departments or subsidiaries.
- Personal Finance: Individuals can use the system to settle shared expenses, minimizing the number of transactions.
